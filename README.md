# IMDb
A simple IMDb application for windows </br>
I designed it with Java, and used JavaFX </br>
This app fetches the last top 250 movies of IMDb from its website </br>
If you click on any of the movies, you can show the movie Icon, movie name, director, some actors and the rating of the movie. </br>
